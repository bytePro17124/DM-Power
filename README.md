#### How-to compile and run:

1. You will need a C++ compiler. I usually use the latest GNU version but this should work with about any. You may need to google how to include or install any missing dependancies. This program uses C++ and Boost. You can install both of these through cygwin (64 bit or 32 bit - search 'gcc' and then install all and same with 'boost') for free on Windows. I've been told the colors in terminal don't work correctly in Visual Studio's compiler.
2. Compiling command options:  
    * Use ```qmake dmpower.pro``` to build a makefile, then do ```make``` in terminal.
    * Or use the makefile I've already generated by just typing ```make``` in the directory.   
    * Or probably the best option for keeping it simple, just type ```g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o dmpower``` in terminal while in the directory.  
3. Once done building, type ```./dmpower``` or ```./dmpower.exe``` (whichever it builds) in your command line to run the program.

* Why did I go through the pain of making this? Ever since I started playing D&D many years ago, I began looking for useful programs to go along with the game. There seemed to be a million little half-built tools and websites or many that don't follow the rules enough to be both useful and fair. I wasn't interested in a random person's homebrew ideas, which ruled out 90% of what I found. Since I couldn't find a program that did all this stuff legit from the books, and even Wizard's paid programs are too convoluted to be of use during gameplay, in my opinion, I decided to hack it myself. It also gave me something to work on while not taking classes and a motive to keep programming. So there you go. If you find it useful, let me know. Any feedback is good feedback.
* Final note: You will need the books, this program doesn't replace them or go into details about what abilities, spells, and items do. Go buy them from an official retailer!
