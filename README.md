### 4. Additional Notes

- This interactive toolkit uses some coloring of text that will probably look best in a terminal with a dark background.
- This D&D Toolkit uses Wizards of the Coast (WotC) rules and is free and open source.
- This tool is best suited for Dungeon Masters, however the character creator flow has been proving irreplacable for some of players in my circle. 
- No known crash cases. All crash case reports are taken as highly critical and will be fixed asap.
- This toolkit does not teach the game or say many specifics about what each ability, magic item, or spell does, as that is just not the intention. These details can be found on the plethora of reference data sites and apps related to D&D 5e, as well as in the official books. I recommend purchasing official [WotC books](#3-credits).
