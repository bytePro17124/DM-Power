First off, to Cover My Ass, I will explain -> **You will need the books.** This program doesn't replace them or go into details about what abilities, spells, and items do, so you'll be lost without the books. Go buy them from an official retailer and support the company that makes this sweet D&D game!

    * **All** Loot Reward rolling charts from the DMG. Magical items, gems, art, currency.
        * done by the book's logic - any rolled scrolls are automatically ran through the Random Scroll Generator. **save tons of time**
    * Spellbook creator that randomizes wizard spells, just tell it how many of each level and it does the rest. Perfect for when a player askes 'What is in this stolen/looted NPC wizard spellbook?   
    * Random Scroll generator, just tell it what level scroll and it gives a random spell of that level.

	* For when you just need to piss off the PC's or antagonize them with a baddie.  


#### How-to compile and run:
* \*\***NEW**\*\* now no longer requires Boost Libraries, basic C++ will do.
* This runs in terminal. Several options, you decide on what is easiest for you. Mac won't be much different than linux.  

	1. Linux: While in the program directory, in terminal type ```g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o dmpower``` or use the makefile: ```make``` while in this program directory.
	2. Windows: Use Cygwin (64 bit or 32 bit - search 'gcc' and then install all, same with 'git'(might as well get git) and same with 'make') then in Cygwin's terminal got to the program directory and type```g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o dmpower``` or ```make``` if you installed 'make'.  

* Next, use ```./dmpower.exe``` to run it.  
* NOTE: There are probably many other ways to compile this. It is basic C++ code that is using C++11 features.  
* NOTE: This program uses special colored words, which is kinda optional but unfortunantly some terminals don't display these correctly.  


#### Problems?

* If you run into a problem or something unclear - please open an issue ticket or email me. The more details the better.
* Anything you would like to see added to this program - open a issue ticket with the enhancement tag or email me.

* Why did I go through the pain of making this? Ever since I started playing D&D many years ago, I began looking for useful programs to go along with the game. There seemed to be a million little half-built tools and websites or many that don't follow the rules enough to be both useful and fair. I wasn't interested in a random person's homebrew ideas, which ruled out 90% of what I found. Since I couldn't find a program that did all this stuff legit from the books, and even Wizard's paid programs are too convoluted to be of use during gameplay, in my opinion, I decided to hack it myself. It also gave me something to work on while not taking classes and a motive to keep programming. So there you go. If you find it useful, let me know. Any feedback is good feedback.
