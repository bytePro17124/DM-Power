#### How-to compile and run:

1. You will need a c++ compiler. I usually use the latest GNU version but this should work with about any. You may need to google how to include or install any missing dependancies. This program uses C++ and Boost. You can install both of these through cygwin for free on Windows.
2. Compiling command options:  
    *Use ```qmake dmpower.pro``` to build a makefile, then do ```make``` in terminal.  
    *Or use the makefile I've already generated by just typing ```make``` in the directory.   
    *Or probably the best option for keeping it simple, just type ```g++ -std=c++11 *.cpp -o dmpower``` in terminal while in the directory.  
3. Once done building, type ```./dmpower``` ( ```_./dmpower.exe_``` if using cygwin on windows) in terminal to run the program.

* Why? I like D&D and programming. Couldn't find a program that did all this stuff legit from the books. Decided to do it myself for my own personal games.
* If you want to help with this program, please let me know. I realize the code can be cleaned up quite a bit as there where times I just got it working and left it at that. My main goal is to make it uncrashable by normal means.  
* Currently its all been done solo(at times I struggled). Special thanks to the internet for helping me out when I get stuck.
